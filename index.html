        <p>Welcome to the website. This is the introductory paragraph. There are many things to talk about on this website. One such example is HTML. HTML is not a programming language, but it is an interesting system for creating a website nonetheless. People can use HTML to design their own websites. HTML can be combined with CSS to allow for styles and designs to be used on the website. The confluence of HTML and CSS creates a virtual playground that is fun for everyone involved. If you enjoy websites, I highly suggest using HTML and CSS to create your own website.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mixing the ground beef, breadcrumbs, and eggs creates a starchy panade that traps the juices, resulting in a juicy meatball.</li>
            <li>Broiling browns the surface and activates the Maillard reaction, producing hundreds of new flavor compounds</li>
            <li>Simmering the meatballs in acidic tomato sauce tenderizes the beef for the best texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Beef gives the best flavor for meatballs.</li>
            <li>Do not use chicken.</li>
            <li>This is how you make a good meatball.</li>
