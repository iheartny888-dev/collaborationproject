        <p><strong>What is War?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>War is the use of violence to enact the will of the state.</li>
            <li>War is a political endeavor, because policy necessarily cannot contradict the aims of war.</li>
            <li>States engage in war to advance the political aims of the state.</li>
            <li>In ideal war, each opponent must necessarily escalate the conflict until the utter destruction of the enemy is assured. Since the escalation of both sides is inevitable, this escalation will continue indefinitely.</li>
            <li>However, in real war, the means of war cannot exceed the ends of policy or war will become overly exploitative and chaotic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Friction and Fog of War</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Friction refers to the minor unforseen difficulties that differentiate real war from ideal war.</li>
          <li>Friction allows for the commander's will, experience, and creativity to shine, independent from the algebraic nature of ideal war.</li>
          <li>Fog of war refers to uncertainty about the enemy. This can include an inability to determine their plans, intentions, strength, or their center of gravity, or even one's own situation.</li>
          <li>This imperfection of information accounts for the imperfection in calculations in real war.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Wonderous Trinity</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>War is governed by passion, chance, and reason.</li>
          <li>Passion refers to the emotions and irrational anger of the populace.</li>
          <li>Chance refers to the commander's ability to capitalize on his situation, as well as the presence of uncertainty.</li>
          <li>Reason refers to a government's political aims.</li>
          <li>War cannot be governed purely by passion, because it will escalate beyond the confines of reality.</li>
          <li>War cannot be governed purely by chance, because there would be no ability to effectively control armies.</li>
          <li>War cannot be governed purely by reason, because humans are imperfect and are always bound to fail.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Schwerpunkt</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The schwerpunkt, or the center of gravity, refers to the source of the enemy's power.</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Beef gives the best flavor for meatballs.</li>
            <li>Do not use chicken.</li>
            <li>This is how you make a good meatball.</li>
        </ol>
